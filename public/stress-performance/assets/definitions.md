**Definitions: networks and network drawings**  
A network is made up of objects and connections. For example, this social network depicts people (represented as circles) and friendships (represented as lines between the circles). Amy has four friends; Ted has two.

<!-- The same network can be drawn in many different ways by changing the position of the objects. For example, here are four drawings of the same network.

<table style="width:100%; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="assets/images/2.jpg" width="200"/></td>
    <td><img src="assets/images/3.jpg" width="200"/></td>
    <td><img src="assets/images/4.jpg" width="200"/></td>
    <td><img src="assets/images/5.jpg" width="200"/></td>
  </tr>

A ‘path’ is a series of steps between objects. For example, in the network below, the length of the path between G and F is 4; the length of the path between A and D is 2 or 3 (depending on whether you go through B or not).

The ‘shortest path’ is, as its name suggests, the shortest path when there is more than one way to get from one object to another.
For example, in the network below, the length of the shortest path between F and B is 2 (going through A, but not C or G/H/E); the length of the shortest path between D and H is 4 (going through C/A, but not through B or F/G).
