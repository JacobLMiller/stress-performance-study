You are invited to take part in this study. Please read this Explanatory Statement in full before deciding whether or not to participate in this research. If you would like further information regarding any aspect of this project, you are encouraged to contact the researchers via the phone numbers or email addresses listed above.

There will be a short test at the start of the study to ensure that you understand the relevant concepts.
You will receive training and examples on the relevant concepts in advance of this test.

**What does the research involve?**  
The aim of the study is to investigate how visual aspects of networks impact task performance. The results of this experiment can help guide the design of visualisations of networks, for ease of understanding. We focus on how visually balanced (or ‘stressed’) networks appear.
 
You will be asked to look at a network and select the length of the shortest path between two highlighted nodes (shown in red). You will be given an explanation of networks and the concept of a shortest path before the experiment begins.
 
You will be shown up to 27 drawings. The total experiment should not take more than 20 minutes.
 
The experiment will be conducted online. The data that will be collected for each pair of networks will be your answer and your response time.
 
At the end of the experiment, you will be asked to complete a short questionnaire that will take approximately 2-3 minutes. This questionnaire will ask you for some demographic details (gender identity, age-range), and will ask some questions about your perceived difficulty of the tasks and your strategies in completing them.
 

<br/>

**How much time does the experiment take?**  
The total experiment will take between 10-15 minutes; it will not take more than 20 minutes.
 

<br/>

**Why have you been chosen for the experiment?**  
You are registered in a research crowdsourcing service and interested in participation in this experiment.


<br/>

**Consenting to participate in the project and withdrawing from the research**  
By selecting the “next” button below, you consent to participate in this experiment. You may withdraw from further participation at any stage prior to completion of the experiment with implications that are stated in the crowdsourcing service agreement, which you have already agreed upon.
 

<br/>

**Possible benefits and risks to participants**  
By taking part in this experiment, you will be contributing to research to guide the development of systems that will depict, for example, crime networks, social networks and transport networks. We do not anticipate that you will experience any discomfort by taking part.


<br/>

**Confidentiality**  
All data collected throughout this experiment is anonymous and will not be made available outside the immediate researchers. The results will be presented at conferences, published in journal papers, thesis, and book chapters. 
 

<br/>

**Storage of data**  
The data will be stored for at least 5 years on secure Monash University servers accessible only to members of the research team (current and future). It will be deleted after that time, when it is no longer of use. In accordance with the requirements of journals or conferences that publish the results of this research, the data may be deposited in an open source repository in totally de-identified format. This will be available to researchers wishing to use the data in the future.
 
The data will be collected using the ReVISit framework.
