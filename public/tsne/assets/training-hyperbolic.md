# Training: Hyperbolic t-SNE

In the following tasks, you will use a **Hyperbolic t-SNE** visualization.  
This page explains how to interact with the visualization before you begin the study tasks.

---

## What You See

- Points are embedded in a **hyperbolic space**, which allows more data to be shown within a limited viewing area.
- The center of the view shows regions with **less distortion**, while areas farther from the center appear more compressed.
- Re-centering the visualization changes which region is shown with the most detail.

---

## Basic Interaction

### Panning (Re-centering)
- **Click and drag** anywhere in the visualization to **pan** the view.
- Panning moves the visualization so that a different region becomes the center of focus.

### Double-Click to Re-center
- **Double-click** on any location in the visualization to **automatically re-center** the view on that location.
- This is the fastest way to focus on a region of interest.

## Example Screenshot

The image below shows a hyperbolic t-SNE view after re-centering on a region of interest.

## Practice Example (Not Part of the Study)

Before starting the real tasks, you may interact with a **practice dataset**.

Use this example to:
- Pan the visualization using click-and-drag
- Double-click to re-center on different regions
- Observe how the distribution changes as the center moves

Your interactions and responses in the practice example **will not be recorded and do not count toward the study**.

## During the Study

- You may re-center the visualization as often as you like.
- There is no time limit for individual tasks.
- If you are unsure about an answer, make your best judgment and continue.

When you are ready, please continue to begin the study tasks.
