# Training: Hierarchical SNE

In the following tasks, you will use a **Hierarchical SNE (h-SNE)** visualization.  
This page explains how to interact with the visualization before you begin the study tasks.

---

## What You See

- Each point represents a **group of data points** rather than a single item.
- These are sometimes called **super-points**.
- At higher levels, fewer super-points summarize larger parts of the dataset.
- As you move down the hierarchy, the visualization shows **more detailed structure**.

---

## Basic Interaction

### Selecting Super-Points
- Click and drag to draw a **rectangular selection box**.
- All super-points inside the rectangle will be selected.

### Drilling Down
- After selecting one or more super-points, you can **drill down** to a lower level.
- Drilling down reveals a **more detailed view** of the selected groups.
- You may drill down multiple times.

### Going Back Up
- You can return to a **higher (more abstract) level** of the hierarchy at any time.
- Going back up restores a broader overview of the data.

## Example Screenshot

The image below shows an example of selecting super-points and drilling down to a lower level.

## Practice Example (Not Part of the Study)

Before starting the real tasks, you will see a **practice dataset**.

Use this example to:
- Try selecting super-points with the rectangular brush
- Drill down to explore more detailed levels
- Go back up to higher levels

You may interact freely during the practice example.  
**Your answers in the practice example will not be recorded and do not count toward the study.**

Take as much time as you need to become comfortable with the interactions.

## During the Study

- You may move between levels as often as you like.
- There is no time limit for individual tasks.
- If you are unsure about an answer, make your best judgment and continue.

When you are ready, please continue to begin the study tasks.
